# BarberApp
This is a Java GUI program that connects to the database using JDBC.
There are three types of users: Admin, barbers(service providers) and the customers.
customes can register themselves and log in to the system. they can search for a barber and book an appointment for a date that is given by the barber. 
Barbers, after register and login, can see all the appointments made by customers and can update the slots(services, for example haircut).
Admin do not need to register, only need to log in. Admin can see all sr=ervice providers and customer, as weel as delete any of them.
There will be another program, a web page, that has the same features as this java application. both of them connect to the same database.
